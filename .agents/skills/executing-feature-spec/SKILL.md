# When To Use

Use when a feature spec exists in `.agents/features/<name>/` and its tasks need implementation. The agent reads the feature state, determines the active phase, and resumes or begins execution — always operating per-phase, spawning sub-agents for all pending tasks in parallel.

> **Prerequisite**: Load the [executing-skills](../executing-skills/SKILL.md) skill before running this pipeline. It governs how skills are loaded, executed, and verified.

## 1. Load State

- Locate `.agents/features/<name>/`.
- Read FEATURE.md, all TASK.md files — note `type`, `depends-on`, `status`.
  - Read each task's MEMORY.md and, if present, its GATES.md.
  - Validate the spec:
    - FEATURE.md exists and parses correctly (valid YAML frontmatter)
    - All TASK.md files have valid YAML frontmatter
    - All `status` values are in the canonical enum (`pending | in-progress | complete | blocked`)
    - `locked-phases` is parseable as a comma-separated list
    - If any status value is not in the canonical enum, coerce it to `blocked`, log a deviation in the task's MEMORY.md, and warn the user
- Map tasks as: `complete`, `in-progress`, `pending`, `blocked` — the canonical status enum defined in [authoring-feature-spec](../authoring-feature-spec/SKILL.md). Do not invent other status values (e.g. `defect`).
  - Determine active phase: the first phase with any pending/in-progress tasks. Phases listed in FEATURE.md `locked-phases` are skipped (already committed and locked).
  - If a task has `type: defect` child tasks that are still `pending` or `in-progress`, set the parent task's `status: blocked` (per the canonical enum in authoring-feature-spec) and do not treat it as actionable until those children close. To find a task's open defect children, scan all TASK.md whose `originator` is `defect:<this-id>`. The `related-tasks` field is an optional cross-reference only and is not used for blocking.

## 2. Execute Phase

Spawn sub-agents for pending tasks in the active phase, in dependency order:

- **`interruptor` = hard stop.** When any `interruptor` in the active phase becomes runnable, halt spawning of all further tasks and present its context for a required user decision before spawning anything else; re-check after each task completes. An `interruptor` must never run in parallel with other work (interruptor now halts as hard stop).
- **`review` tasks are excluded** from the parallel spawn — they run after the non-review tasks complete (see Step 4) via an independent subagent.
- **`planning` tasks must wait** for any in-phase `exploratory`/`execution`/`defect` tasks listed in their `depends-on` to reach `complete` before being spawned; do not run them in parallel with unfinished dependencies (planning tasks wait for dependencies).
- All other pending tasks whose `depends-on` is satisfied may run in parallel.

Sub-agents MUST read the `MEMORY.md` of any tasks listed in their `depends-on` frontmatter to ingest prior context and handoff instructions. Apply [caveman-compression](../caveman-compression/SKILL.md) **only to free-form prose** when writing files — never compress frontmatter or MEMORY.md `Handoff`/`Deviations` sections and TASK.md `Requirements` (compression scope limited to free-form prose).

## 3. Execute Based on Task `type`

Each task's `type` (in TASK.md frontmatter) determines behavior:

| type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **exploratory** | Scout — read code, map dependencies. Reference `finding-references` if reference source/docs exist locally. Store findings in MEMORY.md. |
| **planning** | Ingest exploration context from MEMORY.md. Design approach, update TASK.md, spawn new tasks if needed. May have GATES.md verifying facts. |
| **execution** | Write/modify code. May optionally have GATES.md for validation (test, lint, format). |
| **interruptor** | Hard stop. Present context, ask user question. Complete only after user answers. |
| **defect** | Fix bugs from phase reviews. Same as execution, focused on `related-tasks`. |
| **review** | Run by an **INDEPENDENT subagent** (never the agents that authored/executed the phase). Execute the `adversarial-review` skill over the completed phase and write findings to `REVIEW.md`. Block completion on human review of `REVIEW.md`; accepted findings become `defect`/`execution` remediation tasks. |

Before executing a task, check the `FEATURE.md` task table's `Gates` column. If `Yes`, the sub-agent must execute and pass `<task-dir>/GATES.md` before marking the task complete. If the column says `Yes` but no `<task-dir>/GATES.md` exists, treat the task as failed and report the mismatch. Conversely, if a `GATES.md` exists but the column says `No`, warn and still execute its gates.

## 4. End-of-Phase Review & Defect Loop

When all **non-review** tasks in the current Phase complete:

1. **Halt execution.**
2. **If the phase contains a `review` task** → run the independent-subagent review flow:
       - Spawn an **independent subagent** (distinct from any agent that authored or executed tasks in this phase) to execute the `adversarial-review` skill over the completed phase. The subagent writes its findings to `REVIEW.md` in the `review` task directory.
       - **Prompt user:** "Phase <X> review ready. Review `REVIEW.md`?" Present the findings.
       - For each **accepted** finding, author a remediation task (`type: defect` or `execution`) referencing the finding. Determine the new task ID by scanning existing tasks in the active phase and incrementing the highest number, using zero-padded three-digit numbering (A001–A999).
       - For each **dismissed** finding, record the reason in `REVIEW.md` under Human Review.
       - Create the remediation task directories (`<PHASE_LETTER><NNN>-<name>/`) within the active phase namespace. Do not nest tasks inside other task directories.
       - Update the Task Table in `FEATURE.md` to include the remediation tasks.
       - Present the remediation task list to the user for approval or modification; iterate until approved.
       - **Execute remediation tasks** with sub-agents (same as step 2). After execution, reset the phase's review task `status` to `pending` and re-run the independent-subagent review (loop back to the adversarial-review step) until no accepted findings remain.
       - Keep the `review` task `status` as `pending` throughout the review/defect loop. Only mark it `complete` after the human reports "no issues" at the Phase X complete prompt (step 3).
3. **Prompt user:** "Phase <X> complete. Review work?" (manual catch-all beyond the `review` task).
4. **If user reports issues** → agent groups reported issues into defect tasks:
        - Each defect task gets `type: defect`, `originator: defect:<parent-task-id>` linking to the originating task in the same phase.
        - Determine the new task ID by scanning the existing tasks in the active phase (e.g., A001, A002) and incrementing the highest number (e.g., A003).
        - Create a standard task directory (`<PHASE_LETTER><NNN>-<name>/`) for each defect task within the active phase namespace. Do not nest tasks inside other task directories.
       - Update the Task Table in `FEATURE.md` to include the newly appended defect tasks.
       - Present the generated defect task list to the user for approval or modification.
       - Iterate until user approves the proposed defect tasks.
5. **Execute defect tasks** with sub-agents (same as step 2).
6. **Loop back** to step 3 (review again) until user reports no issues.

## 5. Per-Phase Commit

Once user approves phase with no issues:

1. Load [planning-git-commits](../planning-git-commits/SKILL.md).
2. Plan commits and show plan to user.
3. Wait for user approval or modification requests.
4. Iterate until user approves.
5. Create commits. Append the completed phase letter to FEATURE.md frontmatter `locked-phases` (comma-separated, e.g. `A,B`) to lock it, then proceed to the next phase. A locked phase is skipped on re-entry (see Step 1).
