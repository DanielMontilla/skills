# When To Use

Use when the user wants to examine vendor source code, find a specific vendor package in the project, or understand what vendors are available.

> **Prerequisite**: Load the [executing-skills](../executing-skills/SKILL.md) skill before running this pipeline. It governs how skills are loaded, executed, and verified.

# Pipeline

## 1. Identify Vendor Request

Determine which vendor or type of vendor code the user needs based on their request.

## 2. Locate Vendor

Search the `vendor/` directory for matching vendor packages using Glob. Cross-reference with the Vendor Registry in the Reference section below.

## 3. Present Information

For each matching vendor, provide:
- **Path**: Location under `vendor/`
- **Purpose**: What the library does
- **URL**: Original source repository

## 4. Read Vendor Code (if requested)

If the user wants to read or analyze vendor source, navigate to the vendor directory and read the relevant files.

# Reference

> **⚠️ Vendors are READ ONLY.** They are git submodules included for local reference and analysis only. They are **not** dependencies of the monorepo, its packages, services, or applications. Do not modify vendor files or import from them in production code.
