# When To Use

Use when reviewing code, a pull request, or a diff and the user wants more than a polite pass — they want a skeptical, adversarial review that *assumes something is wrong* and tries to prove it. Triggers include "review this PR", "check my code for bugs", "audit this diff", "what could go wrong here", or "be brutal about this change".

> **Prerequisite**: Load the [executing-skills](../executing-skills/SKILL.md) skill before running this pipeline. It governs how skills are loaded, executed, and verified.

# Mindset

Adopt the stance of a hostile reviewer whose job is to find the defect the author missed. Do not assume the code is correct; assume it is subtly broken and prove otherwise. For every claim "this works", ask "when does it not?" Prefer concrete evidence (a code path, an input, a state) over vague concerns.

# Pipeline

## 1. Map the Change

Before judging, understand what changed and why:

- Identify the entry points, public surface, and callers affected.
- Note the intended behavior vs. what the code actually does.
- Trace the primary happy path end to end.

## 2. If Reviewing a Feature Spec — Adversarial Spec Audit

> **Only run this step if the target is a feature spec** — i.e., a directory `.agents/features/<name>/` with `FEATURE.md`, `TASK.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and possibly `GATES.md` (see [authoring-feature-spec](../authoring-feature-spec/SKILL.md) and [executing-feature-spec](../executing-feature-spec/SKILL.md)). If the review targets plain code, skip to Step 3.

Assume the spec is incomplete or wrong and prove it. Audit the spec artifacts for:

- **Requirements/goal gaps**: requirements or goals that are vague, unmeasurable, or missing; success criteria that cannot be verified. Flag requirements with no corresponding task.
- **Task coverage**: tasks whose work is not traceable to a requirement/goal (scope creep); requirements not covered by any task.
- **Missing gates on execution**: any `execution` task that declares a `GATES.md` but omits `format:check`, `lint:check`, `ts:check`, and `test` where applicable. A missing `GATES.md` is only a Minor finding when the task modifies code and has no other validation path — gates are optional per authoring-feature-spec (see REVIEW.md F4). These tasks can complete unvalidated.
- **Untested tasks**: `execution` tasks with no test plan or test gate — a defect hiding place.
- **Dependency integrity**: `depends-on` / `related-tasks` referencing non-existent task IDs, cycles, or ordering that makes a phase unexecutable; tasks that depend on work in a later phase.
- **Type misuse**: `interruptor` tasks that don't actually require a hard user decision (false gates); `defect` tasks missing `related-tasks`; `exploratory`/`planning` tasks that should have fact-verifying gates but don't.
- **Phase correctness**: phases that cannot be independently verified (no gates at end), or tasks within a phase that must run sequentially but are assumed parallel.
- **Completion criteria**: tasks whose completion checklist is empty or missing, so "done" is undefined.
- **Deviations/risk blind spots**: `MEMORY.md` missing an Open Questions or Deviations section where risks exist; undocumented assumptions that could break execution.
- **Scope/phasing**: missing phases (e.g., no migration, rollback, or observability phase) for a feature that needs them.

Emit these as findings in the same severity/report format as the rest of the review, with `file_path:line` pointing at the relevant `FEATURE.md`/`TASK.md`/`GATES.md` entries.

## 3. Hunt for Bugs (Correctness)

Look for defects that produce wrong results or crashes. Check:

- **Off-by-one / boundary** errors: empty collections, `n=0`, first/last element, `length-1`, exclusive vs inclusive ranges.
- **Null / undefined / nil** handling: optional fields, uninitialized vars, missing guards, `null` propagation through chains.
- **State mutation**: shared mutable state across calls, mutation of inputs, stale closures, race conditions in async/concurrent code.
- **Control flow**: unreachable branches, inverted conditions, missing `else`, fall-through in `switch`, early returns that skip cleanup.
- **Numeric**: integer overflow/underflow, float precision, division by zero, sign errors, mixing units.
- **Resource leaks**: unclosed handles, connections, streams, listeners, timers, un-cancelled subscriptions.
- **Concurrency**: races, deadlocks, lost updates, non-atomic read-modify-write, unguarded shared state.
- **Error handling**: swallowed exceptions, bare `catch`, error masking, wrong error type rethrown, silent failures, missing rollback.
- **Time / timezone / locale**: DST, leap years, UTC vs local, date math, formatting assumptions.
- **Recursion / iteration**: stack overflow on deep input, missing termination, exponential blowup.

## 4. Hunt for Security Holes

- Injection (SQL, command, template, XSS, LDAP, path traversal).
- Missing authz/authentication checks; IDOR on object ownership.
- Untrusted input used in `eval`, deserialization, redirects, `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Secrets logged, hardcoded, or committed; insufficient redaction.
- Missing rate limiting, brute-force exposure, weak validation.
- Unsafe dependencies; unpinned versions; known CVEs.
- TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) between validation and use.

## 5. Hunt for Edge Cases & Robustness

Assume adversarial inputs and hostile environments:

- Empty, null, huge, negative, NaN, `Infinity`, malformed, duplicate, or out-of-order inputs.
- Encoding/Unicode: surrogate pairs, combining chars, emoji, RTL, length vs code-point count, case folding.
- Network: timeouts, retries, partial responses, reordered packets, duplicate delivery.
- Disk full, permission denied, file locked, missing file.
- Backwards/forwards compatibility of schema, API, or data format changes.
- Behavior at scale: N+1 queries, O(n²) on large inputs, unbounded growth of caches/maps/arrays.

## 6. Judge the Design & Missed Opportunities

Find where better code was possible:

- **Duplication**: repeated logic that should be a shared helper (consider [detecting-duplication](../detecting-duplication/SKILL.md)).
- **Over-engineering**: premature abstraction, unneeded generics, layers that add no value, speculative config.
- **Under-engineering**: missing validation, weak typing, magic numbers/strings, implicit assumptions.
- **SOLID violations**: see [applying-solid](../applying-solid/SKILL.md) for the checklist.
- **Naming & clarity**: misleading names, comments that lie, dead code, commented-out blocks.
- **API ergonomics**: surprising signatures, inconsistent conventions, footguns in the public surface.
- **Performance**: wasteful recomputation, redundant I/O, missing memoization, unnecessary copying.

## 7. Assess Test Coverage

- Which branches, error paths, and edge cases have **no** test?
- Do tests assert real behavior or just restate the implementation (see [unit-testing](../unit-testing/SKILL.md))?
- Are boundary values (empty, max, null) exercised?
- Are failure modes (timeout, thrown error, bad input) covered?
- Is there flakiness: dependence on time, order, randomness, global state?
- Missing property-based, fuzz, or integration tests where they would catch real bugs.

## 8. Assess Documentation & Operability

- Misleading, missing, or stale docstrings/README/comments (see [writting-jsdoc](../writting-jsdoc/SKILL.md)).
- Public API undocumented or documented incorrectly.
- No changelog entry, migration note, or deprecation warning for breaking changes.
- Missing observability: no logging, metrics, or tracing on failure paths.
- No runbook/alert for production impact; unclear rollback path.

## 9. Report

Produce a prioritized, evidence-backed review. Structure:

- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Nit.
- **Location**: `file_path:line` for each finding.
- **Problem**: concrete, with the trigger (input/state/path) that breaks it.
- **Impact**: what goes wrong for the user or system.
- **Suggestion**: a specific, minimal fix.

Lead with the highest-severity, highest-likelihood bugs. Distinguish confirmed defects (show the failing path) from risks ("untested, could break if…"). Keep nitpicks short and grouped at the end. Do not pad with praise; be direct.
